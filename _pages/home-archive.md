# Hi, I’m Ethan Wise

With a foundation in core programming and systems, I enjoy building practical tools and experimenting across both front-end and back-end development. I’ve worked on a wide range of projects, but often felt limited in how I could showcase them beyond their original use cases. This website is my way of changing that. It's a place to highlight some of my favorite work and reflect on my journey as a developer.

## Featured Projects

- **Fitness Tracking App**  
  Mobile-friendly progressive web app for tracking workouts and personal goals.

- **Number Base Converter with Bitwise Logic**  
  JavaScript tool for translating between binary, hexadecimal, and decimal systems.

- **Hackathon Project**  
  Developed a CNN-based system to detect unmapped forest roads from LIDAR and elevation data.

- **NoSQL-Powered Tournament Platform**  
  MongoDB-backed dashboard for visualizing sumo tournament data.

- **Rocket Trajectory Tracking**  
  Designed a Kalman Filter for real-time rocket trajectory estimation.

- **Server Creation**  
  Implements a bi-directional Java TCP client-server system.

- **This Website**  
  Jekyll-powered personal portfolio built and styled from scratch.
