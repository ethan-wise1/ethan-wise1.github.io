# Hi, I’m Ethan Wise

With a foundation in core programming and systems, I enjoy building practical tools and experimenting across both front-end and back-end development. I’ve worked on a wide range of projects, but often felt limited in how I could showcase them beyond their original use cases. This website is my way of changing that. It's a place to highlight some of my favorite work and reflect on my journey as a developer.

## Featured Projects

  Built in 24 hours with a team using ...
