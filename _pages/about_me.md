<div class="projects-wrapper">

Growing up, I’ve always been drawn to how things work and, more importantly, how to make them work better. Whether it’s building something from scratch, streamlining a process, or exploring unfamiliar technologies, I’m most engaged when I’m in a state of constant improvement, and I bring that mindset to everything I do.

Over the course of my learning, I’ve explored different areas of tech, from low-level scripting to building software powered by authentic data with real-world implications aimed at bettering people's lives. What drives me isn’t just learning new tools or languages; it’s understanding how to use them intentionally to create a better future for others. I stay motivated by tackling real-world problems, architecting systems that are both scalable and user-focused, and adapting as both tools and challenges evolve.

This site reflects that process and serves as a living archive of things I’ve built, tested, refined, and sometimes completely reworked.
