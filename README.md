# Ethan Wise – Personal Portfolio

This is the source code for my personal website and portfolio, built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted via GitHub Pages.

 **Live Site**: [ethan-wise1.github.io](https://ethan-wise1.github.io)

##  About

This site serves as a central hub to showcase projects I've worked on, reflect on my journey as a developer, and highlight my evolving interests in full-stack development.
Some of the projects featured here were the result of group efforts, and while I’ll be sure to give credit where it’s due, I want to be clear that I didn’t build everything entirely on my own. It’s also worth noting that many of these projects were completed at different stages of my learning, and some may not reflect the most efficient or polished solutions by my current standards. If I were to rebuild them today, I could likely improve both the speed and structure, but that’s not the point. This site is about showing what I’ve accomplished so far and how far I’ve come.
