MusclePal was a collaborative group project focused on designing a comprehensive user interface for a fitness application. Our team was responsible for the entire UI/UX design process. From ideation and defining use cases to creating activity diagrams and ultimately delivering a functional mockup. The concept centered around a fitness companion app that allows users to track calorie intake, build custom workout plans, and shop for gym-related apparel and supplements through an integrated store.

While the initial project scope was limited to front-end design, one of our team members later extended the work by developing a functional mock application with back-end integration. Although the app is not publicly released, the mockup operates as a working prototype of our original vision.
