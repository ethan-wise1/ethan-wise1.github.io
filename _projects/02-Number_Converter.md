This project was a school coding assignment focused on building a number base converter capable of translating values between binary, decimal, and hexadecimal in any direction, as well as performing one’s and two’s complement operations. To ensure a deeper understanding of number systems, we were not allowed to use built-in parsing methods like Integer.parse() in our implementation. Instead, the converter was built entirely from scratch using manual string manipulation and step-by-step arithmetic, emulating the base conversion process without relying on modern libraries or shortcuts.
