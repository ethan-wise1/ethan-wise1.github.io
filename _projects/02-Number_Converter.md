This project was a school coding assignment focused on building a number base converter capable of translating values between binary, decimal, and hexadecimal in any direction, performing one’s and two’s complement operations, and executing bitwise logical operations such as AND, OR, and XOR, as well as shifting bits two places to the left or right. To ensure a deeper understanding of number systems, we were not allowed to use built-in parsing methods like Integer.parse() in our implementation. Instead, the converter was built entirely from scratch using manual string manipulation and step-by-step arithmetic, emulating the base conversion process without relying on modern libraries or shortcuts.
