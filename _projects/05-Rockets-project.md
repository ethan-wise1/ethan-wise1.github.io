This project represents a collaborative effort between ElevateCS (a computer science club I'm part of) and Ram Rocketry (a club composed primarily of aerospace engineering students), centered on advanced systems engineering and control theory applications. The primary objective was to design and implement a Kalman Filter capable of fusing data from multiple onboard sensors to produce an accurate, real-time model of the rocketâ€™s dynamics and improve trajectory estimation. By integrating diverse sensor inputs, the system aims to enhance both the precision and reliability of flight path predictions. The project was guided by systems engineering principles, with an emphasis on creating a robust and well-structured design through interdisciplinary collaboration.
