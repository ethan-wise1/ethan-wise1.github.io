This group project focused on designing a mock web application that showcases how a NoSQL database can power a dynamic 
and data-driven user experience. The platform was modeled around sumo wrestling tournaments, offering users the ability to
browse upcoming events, purchase tickets, view real-time wrestler statistics, and explore techniques of the sport. We used 
MongoDB as the NoSQL backend to store structured wrestling data, including individual wrestler profiles and performance metrics. 
The application demonstrated querying this data in real time to drive interactive graphs and visualizations, allowing users to 
explore historical trends and compare wrestler statistics. The project emphasized scalable data access, efficient querying, and 
real-time updates, highlighting the strengths of MongoDB and NoSQL technologies in read-heavy, analytical use cases.
